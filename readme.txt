Instant Google Analytics installs the Universal Google Analytics Tracking Code to your WordPress theme header with a single click.

== Description ==

Instant Google Analytics installs the Universal Google Analytics Tracking Code to your WordPress theme header with a single click.  This plugin provides a super light-weight, yet robust method of connecting your WordPress website with Google Analytics.

There are dozens of plugins that will install Google Analytics tracking code, but our goal was to get that perfect mix between lightweight code and minimal setup with usability, performance, and security.

Features:
	1. Places the tracking code in the head where Google recommends. (This helps to ensure that analytics tracking is performed before a user can navigate away from the page.)
	2. Removes your Tracking ID and all data from the database when the plugin is uninstalled.
	3. Extremely light-weight, fast, and simple to use. Only a 1-click setting, and does not introduce unnecessary  overhead for instant loading and operation.
	4. Secure! Input validation, authorized access control, and more.
	5. Simple instructions with images to show you where to find your Google Analytics Tracking ID in Google Analytics.
	6. Google Analytics javascript code is neatly printed in the head of the document to keep your html easy to read and organized.
	7. Uses class architecture to prevent conflicts with other plugins or themes.
	8. No coding needed.

Perfect For:
	* Business Owners - The quickest, simplest, and most robust way to send tracking data to Google Analytics. No coding needed.
	* Blogs - Collecting traffic data can help you monetize your site.
	* Informational (Brochure) Websites - No need to muck through pages of settings that you will never need.
	* Ecommerce Websites - Don't wait for a more complex setup to begin collecting tracking data. Sets up in seconds.
	* Developers - When you need to get Google Analytics tracking data immediately, but want a clean, light-weight solution.
